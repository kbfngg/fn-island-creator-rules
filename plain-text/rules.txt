WELCOME FORTNITE CREATOR!
The Fortnite Creative & Unreal Editor for Fortnite tools allow you to create islands that can be published within Fortnite.

Fortnite aims to be a safe and fun place for people to play games or hang with their friends, exactly as we say in our Community Rules. 

As you create new islands, games, and experiences within Fortnite, we need your help to keep Fortnite safe, fun, and welcoming to everyone. We also want to make it easy for you to create and be successful with your Fortnite island. 

These rules outline the appropriate ways to create, promote, and monetize your Fortnite island, including some important dos and don’ts. Please take the time to read them carefully before you publish your first Fortnite island and best of luck! 


TL;DR:
Whether built using Fortnite or Unreal Editor for Fortnite, your island is your responsibility, and you must comply with the following rules:

Your islands must comply with the rules below, and the Epic Games Content Guidelines.

Your behavior must comply with the rules below, and the Epic Games Community Rules.

Any promotion of your island, both within and outside of Fortnite, must comply with the rules below, and the Fortnite Creative Branding Guidelines. 


THE RULES
1. CONTENT RULES & GUIDELINES

As we work together to ensure Fortnite stays a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, your Fortnite content must follow these rules:

1.1 A Safe Environment - Don’t contribute to content involving or promoting illegal activities, including harassment, bullying, assault, doxing, swatting, gambling, illegal drugs, animal cruelty, fraud, hacking, and piracy. Content that condones or incites violence against others has no place in Fortnite.

1.2 Keep Personal Info Private - To help avoid deceptive practices (phishing, buying/selling account information), do not disclose or request personal information anywhere in your island. To preserve the privacy of others, you must not gather, share, or exploit the personal information of individuals or organizations through the use of your island, or attempt to. Do not include videos or photographs of people (yourself or others) anywhere in your island or metadata. Do not provide methods within your island for players to text chat other than via a set of limited pre-determined phrases (sometimes known as “canned chat”) or the Epic-provided social features.

1.3 Intolerance and Discrimination - Fortnite welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, national origin, and other groups. Content should not demean, marginalize, use hateful language against, or belittle other users or groups. 

1.4 Love… Don’t Hate - Don’t create content that includes hateful symbols or depictions or content that glorifies or incites violence.

1.5 Bullying and Harassment - Respect others that participate in your creation. Interacting with others in a way that is predatory, threatening, intimidating, lewd, demeaning, derogatory, invasive of privacy, or abusive is against the rules.

1.6 Give Credit Where It’s Due - Don’t impersonate other users, streamers, celebrities, government officials, Epic employees, or anyone else. Don’t take credit for another user’s creation. Pretending to be someone else in order to deceive or defraud others is not okay.

1.7 Play by the Rules - Do not create islands that promote the use of known cheats, exploits, glitched items, server crashes, and bugs. Do not use your island as a way to scam other players, examples including dishonest practices like exploiting the Support-A-Creator program or featuring clickbait advertisements.

1.8 Appropriate Language Only - Don’t name your island or include on your island obscene text or symbols, nor spelling variations, or visual depictions of text aimed at evading these rules.

1.9 All Bets Are Off - Don’t implement gambling, raffles, or casino-style games that involve real money or V-Bucks.

1.10 Keep It on the Island - Do not include offsite web links anywhere on your island. Note: Promotion of social media handles/channels is fine provided they don’t include a URL.

1.11 Keep It Authentic - When promoting your island inside Fortnite, the assets (such as thumbnail images or videos) you use to represent your Fortnite island must accurately represent what players will experience in your island; you must not mislead players as to the sort of experience they will have. You may not incorporate photographs. You must not incorporate elements that mislead players with regards to XP gains, in-game items, or Quests. Where Fortnite already provides a visual element to indicate a feature to the players (e.g. the ability to earn XP in your island, or the selection border of a game tile), you must not imitate or supplement it.

1.12 Stay within Spec Guidelines - Make sure the islands you’re creating do not cause server issues, intentionally or not. Frame rates should stay above 30 FPS. Don’t exceed 100,000 units anywhere on your island, as shown in the Thermometer. For UEFN projects specifically, the total size of the project should not exceed 2GB, and once cooked, the final island should fit in the 400MB limit for players to download.

1.13 Align with Fortnite’s Game Rating - Fortnite is a teen-rated title (e.g. ESRB Teen 13+, PEGI 12, etc.). Only create content that is appropriate for a teen audience. For example, we don’t permit content “made for kids” or “adult content” (no nursery rhymes, no pole dancing). When creating or publishing content for Fortnite, your content must align to Fortnite’s rating in all jurisdictions where Fortnite has a rating and you must follow these content rules:

Violence & Gore: Violence must never be realistic. Death animations and kill replays are not permitted. Gore of any kind is not permitted, including any reference to real or fake blood. Your content may contain horror themes and/or “scary” content, but neither may be intense or sustained. You must avoid disturbing images.

Language: Use of mild profanity and innuendo is permitted, but must not be frequent. Hateful or discriminatory language of any kind is not permitted. Sexual expletives of any kind are not permitted. 

Sexually Suggestive Themes: Romantic themes are permitted. Sexually suggestive themes and references are permitted, but must not be strong or frequent. Depictions of sexual activities are not permitted in any form.

Alcohol and Drug References: References to alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs, or drug-taking are not permitted in any form.


1.14 Misuse of Epic Systems - Epic maintains many systems to keep our users safe and their data secure. Do not attempt to bypass these protections to gain unauthorized access to any Epic systems or data. Do not attempt to gain sensitive information from players through deceptive means. Do not attempt to create or distribute malicious software via Epic systems.

1.15 Respect IP Ownership - The content you create, publish, or use cannot infringe or violate someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another’s copyright or trademark). You must own or have obtained the necessary rights to share and publish the content, and any such license must be broad enough to grant Epic a license consistent with the Fortnite EULA and UEFN Supplemental Terms.   


2. WORKING WITH OTHERS

2.1 If you engage another island creator to help you build your experience or, similarly, if you agree to help another island creator create their experience, it is an agreement between you and that person. Epic Games is in no way a party to your agreement and is not responsible for it in any way.

2.2 If you are interested in utilizing custom video content in your island and want to learn how to do that, please contact us using the Creator Support Form to find out how to get early access to that functionality.

2.3. Unreal Editor for Fortnite permits adult creators to work together in teams, which are managed using the Fortnite Creator Portal. As the owner of a team, you are responsible for ensuring the content created and published by that team adheres to these rules, even if another member of your team made or imported content that violates these rules.


3. PROMOTING YOUR ISLAND

We want to make it easy for you to promote your Fortnite island to help it be successful. Promotion of your island, whether within or outside of Fortnite, must follow these rules:

4. MONETIZING YOUR EXPERIENCE

We want to make it as easy as possible for you to monetize your Fortnite experience while maintaining transparency for players. These rules outline what you can and cannot do to monetize your Fortnite experience:

4.1. Engagement Payouts

4.1.1. As an island creator, you may monetize your experiences via engagement payouts, if you are eligible. To participate in this program, please apply at the Island Creator signup page.

4.1.2. Islands that use the "Battle Royale Island" starter island are ineligible for engagement payouts. 

4.2 Support-A-Creator Program

4.2.1. If you create media content on other platforms which promotes your Fortnite content, or promotes Fortnite content created by others, you may participate in Epic’s Support-A-Creator program. To participate in this program, please apply at the Support-A-Creator page.

4.2.2 The Support-A-Creator program is an affiliate marketing program, intended for active media creators. To learn more about the eligibility requirements for Support-A-Creator, please see the Support-A-Creator FAQ.

4.2.3. As a member of the Support-A-Creator program, you are free to advertise your Creator Code anywhere outside of Fortnite. If you are active in both engagement payout and Support-A-Creator, you must not solicit support for your Creator Code anywhere within your island, including a pre-game lobby, or in its metadata (name, description, thumbnail, loading screen text, or Discover video). We understand that this was previously the key method of monetization for island creators, but this method has now been deprecated and such elements must be removed by April 5, 2023.

4.3 Commercial Content and Sponsorships

Brands and creators are welcome to collaborate in Fortnite, as long as they follow these rules and any applicable laws. You cannot pay Epic Games to promote your content within Fortnite.

4.3.1. Commercial content is permitted in your Fortnite experience. Commercial content is defined as any island that contains content which promotes or endorses a brand, product, service, or organization. 

4.3.2. Commercial content is either “Paid,” which needs to be disclosed by the island creator, or “Owned,” which does not need to be disclosed by the island creator.

Paid commercial content is an island that contains, either in the island itself or its metadata, content for which you have been compensated (i.e. received anything of value, including money, goods, and/or services) by others. This content may be in the form of sponsorship, endorsement, takeover, placement, or other actions.

Owned commercial content is an island that is built or controlled by a brand or other commercial entity.


4.3.3. If you create Paid content, you are responsible for complying with any applicable laws around disclosing your relationship with the sponsor/brand.

4.3.4.  Individual creators must be at least 18 to create or publish Paid commercial content. 

4.3.5. Whether commercial content or not, your island’s metadata (name, description, thumbnail, loading screen text, and/or Discover video) must not include calls to action, product claims, dates, or pricing. These things are okay inside your experience. Examples of things that aren’t allowed in your island’s metadata: 

“Go to onlinestore.com to learn more!”

“Available now for only $19.99!”

“This product works better than ever!”

“See event at 9 PM on TV channel, on this day!”


4.3.6. Commercial content and sponsors must follow all the content rules above, and the Epic Content Guidelines, and must not: 

promote the purchase, sale, or trade of any medical, pharmaceutical, or supplemental products or services;

promote membership to or solicit donations to political organizations;  

promote enrollment in the military;

promote real-money gambling; 

promote the purchase, sale, or trade of real-world explosives, firearms, or ammunition;

promote the purchase, sale, or trade of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana (regardless of legality), illegal drugs, and other illegal, contraband, or regulated goods;

promote deceptive or harmful financial products and services; 

promote real-world dating, romantic introductions, or hook-ups.


4.3.7.  You may sell sponsorships for “in-person” events, tournaments, and competitions related to your experience, provided your event complies with all the Fortnite Event License Terms and the Fortnite Third Party Event Brand Guidelines.

4.4 Monetization Practices to Avoid

4.4.1. You must not restrict access to specific content or items within an experience via external sites; all content should be accessible in-game.
